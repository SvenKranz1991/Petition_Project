# "Let's just walk..." - A Petition against the infamous "E-Roller"

"Let's just walk..." was my second project built within 5 days at SPICED Academy - an onsite 12 weeks coding bootcamp in Berlin.

The Website was built with Handlebars.js and jQuery, Node.js and Express.js, PostgreSQL.

People can Signup or Login on my Website, create or change their Profiles and Sign the Petition on an Canvas Element.
After signing they see a List of other Users who have signed and can filter the results by Location.
