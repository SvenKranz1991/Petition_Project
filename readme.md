steps to completing part 1:

express-handlebars templates

-   should also render the number of people who have signed the petition
-   "signers" template that should render the first and last names of everyone who has signed the petition
-   and you'll need 1 layout

DB queries

-   INSERT when user signs the petition (so provides first, last, and signature)
-   SELECT to get number of signers
-   SELECT to get the first and last names of everyone who has signed

Styling

-   style your petition

Server Routes

-   GET /petition
-   renders petition template
-   POST /petition
-   that will run whenever the user signs the petition
-   GET /thanks (or /signed â€” you can call it whatever)
-   renders "thank you" template
-   GET /signers
-   renders the "signers" template. will need the first and last names of everyone whose signed petition

SQL stuff

-   we'll need a database and a table for this project.
-   create a table called "signatures" that has the following columns: id, first, last, signature (the signature's data type should be TEXT), timestamp
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

express-handlebars templates

-   "petition" template with a element that the user can actually sign
-   you'll need front-end JS for this. the JS file that contains this code should live in your "public" folder (alongside CSS, imgs, etc.)
-   "thank-you" template that will thank the user for signing the petition, and will include a link to the next page
