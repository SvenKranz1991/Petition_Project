            <h1>E-Bike Services are literally garbage.</h1>
            <p>Services from the likes of Lime, Tier, Circ and Voi are creating a vast amount of electrical waste.
                <br> <br>
            <span class="bold">But not only that.</span>
            <br>
                They are failing with one of their biggest promises:
            <br>
            Being an alternative to public transport.<br><br>

            People rather trade public transportation options or bicycles for these E-Bike Services, because it is more fun (which E-Scooters still are), instead of (like people claimed) using regular cars.
            This was a false claim from the companies to begin with, but for this reason I want you to join us and maybe also to tell your peers next time to "Let's just walk..." to our next destination.

            Join our cause of banning those services from the streets, so we can look for real alternatives instead of supporting some business that isn't sustainable.</p>
